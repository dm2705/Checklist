# Checklist
**Description**:

The Checklist App is a simple web application that allows users to add, manage, and check off tasks in a to-do list format. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app can remember data so starting and stopping the program does not delete tasks, only the user can. 

**Files**:

Checklist.html: The main HTML file that structures the app.
Checklist.css: The CSS file that styles the app.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the app's functionality.
