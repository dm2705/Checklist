# Checklist
**Description**:

The Checklist App is a lightweight front end web application that allows users to create, manage, and check off tasks in a to-do list format. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app stores task data locally, ensuring persistence even after the browser is closed. Only the user can delete tasks—restarting the app will not clear the list.

**Files**:

Checklist.html – The main HTML file that structures the app layout.
Checklist.css – Provides styling and layout for the user interface.
script.js – Handles all core functionality, including adding, checking, and deleting tasks.
